/**
 * Implement the UART-related interfaces for a MSP430 USCI module
 * instance.
 *
 * Interrupt Management
 * --------------------
 *
 * Upon grant of the USCI in UART mode to a client, interrupts are
 * turned off.
 *
 * On the MSP430, when the TX interrupt is raised the MCU
 * automatically clears the UCTXIFG bit that indicates that the TXBUF
 * is available for writing characters.  Rather than maintain local
 * state managed by cooperation between the TX interrupt handler and
 * the send code, we leave the TX interrupt disabled and rely on the
 * UCTXIFG flag to indicate that single-byte transmission is
 * permitted.
 *
 * An exception to this is in support of the UartSerial.send()
 * function.  The transmit interrupt is enabled when the outgoing
 * message is provided; subsequent sends are interrupt-driven, and the
 * interrupt is disabled just prior to transmitting the last character
 * of the packet.  This leaves the UCTXIFG flag set upon completion of
 * the transfer.
 *
 * The receive interrupt is enabled upon configuration.  It is
 * controlled using the UartStream functions.  While a buffered
 * receive operation is active, received characters will be stored and
 * no notification provided until the full packet has been received.
 * If no buffered receive operation is active, the receivedByte()
 * event will be signaled for each received character.
 *
 * As with the transmit interrupt, MCU execution of the receive
 * interrupt clears the UCRXIFG flag, making interrupt-driven
 * reception fundamentally incompatible with the busy-waiting
 * UartByte.receive() method.
