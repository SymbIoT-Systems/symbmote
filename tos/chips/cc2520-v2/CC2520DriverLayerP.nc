 * CC2520-v2
 *
 * Differences from original CC2520 driver....
 *
 * o The original CC2520 driver made minimal changes from the CC2420x driver.
 *   But this was inappropriate because the state machines are different.
 *   In particular power states while similar, are different enough.  This
 *   driver fully implements LPM2 (full power down, OFF), LPM1 (STANDBY),
 *   and Active Mode (all the rest).  The CC2420 driver didn't implement
 *   full power down just the equivalent of LPM1.
 *
 * o This drivers supports a stand-alone CC2520 as well as the dual-chip
 *   CC2520-CC2591 range extender combination.
 *
 * o SPI via immediateRequest (arbitration is still supported).  Written for
 *   X5 msp430 processors that have lots of ports.   Assumes dedicated port.
 *   Uses immediateRequest.
 *
 * o Power transitions use PlatformCC2520 methods.   This is because various
 *   manipulations of CC2520 chip pins must be done and on the MSP430 processors
 *   and this is very platform/mcu dependent.  The MCU also has on board pull up,
 *   pull down resistors which we use to hold select i/o lines low to prevent
 *   meta-stable states.
 *
 * o Full LPM2/AM (active mode) support.  Handled by PlatformCC2520
 *   (power{Up,Down} and {sleep,wakeup}).  LPM2 corresponds to the OFF
 *   state and LPM1 STANDBY state.  The CC2420X driver calls STANDBY PD
 *   (for PowerDown) but it isn't really power down but rather
 *   simply has the oscillator turned off.
 *
 *   . Careful attention to powering and depowering CC2520.  Full support
 *     for LPM2/AM transitioning and reinitializing on return to service.
 *     See PlatformCC2520.  After being in OFF/LPM2, the chip will have lost
 *     any configuration information that was previously set.  This includes
 *     any modifications made to gpio programming.  The configuration is
 *     also lost when the chip is reset.
 *
 *   . Keep CC2520 in RESET when powered down, avoids digital glitches as
 *     spec'd in the CC2520 datasheet.  See PlatformCC2520.
 *
 *   . XOSC turn on.  Sets CSN/0 then watches SO.  When SO goes to 1, XOSC
 *     is stable as documented in the CC2520 datasheet.  Only use busy waits
 *     when absolutely necessary.  See PlatformCC2520.  Busy waits also
 *     have hard limits and will Panic if violated.   This prevents a failure
 *     during a busy wait from hanging the system without being visible.
 *
 *   . Properly handle SO becoming an input when RESET or LPM2.  See
 *     PlatformCC2520.   A pull down is used to keep the pin from going
 *     metastable.
 *
 * o SFD timing queueing.  The signal SFD is used to timestamp outgoing and
 *   incoming packets.  There can be one outgoing and possibly several
 *   incoming packets.  As these packets are TX'd or RX'd, the SFD will
 *   cause the SFD pin to rise.  It falls at the end of the packet.  Bottom
 *   line is there can be multiple packets in the system and we need to keep
 *   track of what time stamps are associated with which packets as these
 *   packets move through the system.  As there can only be a TX or RX active
 *   at any one time, the same signal is used to denote the status of the
 *   current packet.  Timestamps come in via time capture h/w.   We capture
 *   both rising and falling edges.  For time capture, only the rising edge
 *   is needed.  The SFD edges are also used to switch driver states.
 *   The FRM_DONE completion exception also approximately indicates the end
 *   of the packet.
 *
 *   We handle this by recording the time when SFD rises and falls for each
 *   packet.  TX/RX status is detemined by current chip state (from status
 *   byte).   The time stamps are inserted into a FIFO queue as the SFD
 *   signal is seen so the stamps are seen in order.  If we miss a time
 *   stamp (because things are taking too long) the h/w will set the
 *   overflow (overwrite) bit.  Timestamping stops until the transmit fifo
 *   and rxfifo are empty.   This can fail depending on packet interarrival
 *   rate.  If too many packets are coming in we never get empty and never
 *   resync.  A timeout can be used to limit how long we go without timestamps.
 *   If that occurs we would "nuke2rxon" to shut the radio down and reset
 *   back to a reasonable state.
 *
 *   The SFDCapture interrupt should be a higher priority than other radio
 *   interrupts.   This is a good thing.  This is so on the msp430 processors
 *   (or can be if the Platform is designed correctly).
 *
 *   A simpler approach would be to simply flush the queues and increment
 *   a counter so we can see if the condition actually happens.  More
 *   complexity can be added later if it is a problem.
 *
 *   You can't just keep going because you don't know when if at all the
 *   SFD edge and time capture will resyncronize.  Depends on traffic
 *   load and whether or not the rxfifo empties.
 *
 *   The reason this works is because we get individual exceptions generated
 *   for each packet (ie. TX_FRM_DONE/RX_FRM_DONE).  As long as we don't take
 *   too long or lose an exception.   It is possible to get out of sync if
 *   we lose an exception.
 *
 * o Full support for CCA.  Use of STXON and STXONCCA as requested by the
 *   outgoing packet.
 *
 * o Support for the 2591 range extender.  Requires modification from the
 *   default (power up default, cc2420 compatability) GPIO setup.  Depending
 *   on the h/w design, GP3-GP5 (at least GP4 and GP5) are used to control
 *   the the 2591 range extender.  The CC2591 HGM pin must either be
 *   connected to the CC2520 or to an MCU pin.
 *
 * o Same driver used for both 2520 standalone and 2520/2591 combination.
 *   Easier to support.
 *
 * o Make better use of exception signalling from the chip.  Both errors and
 *   completion exceptions show up on Exception_A.  We tried seperating them
 *   out but needed the pin for TX_A.
 *
 * o Another signal that is brought out on the GPIO pins is TXA (tx_a),
 *   which indicates the cc2520 state machine is in tx_active.
 *   This is used in the SFDCapture code to determine if the current
 *   packet (SFD rising) is a tx or rx packet.  Part of the proper
 *   functioning of TXONCCA.
 *
 * o Add support for PANIC and PLATFORM timing hooks.
 *
 * Required H/W pins.   The Platform is required to have the following
 * physically wired.  The Platform is responsible for correctly initializing
 * these pins on boot up of the MCU.   (Why?   Because it makes sure that
 * the CC2520 h/w is in a reasonable state as early as possible.   It also
 * allows the Platform code to set blocks of pins (in the I/O registers)
 * rather than doing it piecemeal, which takes a bunch more instructions
 * because it would be done one bit at a time rather than the full byte).
 *
 *  CC2520 pins available:  (directions are relative to the MCU)  The naming
 *  is the default (POR) values for the CC2520.
 *
 *    CSN       chip select, low true   (initially high, output)
 *    VREN      Voltage Reg Enable, high true.  (initially low, output)
 *    RSTN      Reset, low true (initially low, hold chip in reset, output)
 *
 *    GPIO0     GPIO0 by default outputs a 1 MHz clock.  (switched to SFD)
 *
 *    GPIO1     FIFO, (input, default, switched to TXA).
 *    GPIO2     FIFOP, (input, default, switched to EXCA).
 *
 *    gpio3-5 are not used by the driver directly.  PlatformCC2520 is
 *    responsible for dealing with the gp5 default being input.
 *
 *    GPIO3     (defaults to CCA, reserved for 2591, HGM)
 *    GPIO4     (defaults to SFD, reserved for 2591, EN, !lna_pd[1]
 *    GPIO5     (defaults to CC2520 input, reserved for PAEN, !pa_pd) in LPM2
 *              needs to be driven to avoid excessive power consumption.
 *    SO        MISO (master in, slave out).  Data from CC2520 to the MCU.
 *              When the CC2520 XOSC is running, dropping CSN (asserted CS)
 *              has the status of XOSC stable.  1 for stable.   This is
 *              used when turning the oscillators on, see powerUp and wakeup.
 *              See PlatformCC2520.
 *
 *              SO is also monitored for XOSC stabilization.
 *
 *    SI, SCLK  other SPI pins.
 *
 * HGM (2591 configuration) may be wired directly or via the CC2520 via
 *     GPIO3.  TI in their examples, use the CC2520 to set or clear this
 *     signal, but this is stupid because it takes SPI traffic to do this.
 *     But if you don't have the pins, it lets you still take care of it
 *     but shouldn't be the default design.  The eval boards, EXP430F5438
 *     with the CC2520-2591EM module, uses GPIO3 from the CC2520 to control
 *     HGM on the 2591.
 *
 *     setHighGain encapsulates how this is actually implemented.
 *
 * On page 34, "section 10.4, SO" of the CC2520 Datasheet, it states that when
 * "SO is configured as an input when CSn is high or RESETn is low."   When
 * normally being used (Active Mode) but idle CSn will be high, the port will
 * be in SPI mode and the SO pin will be an input to the MCU.   Is this a
 * problem or do we need to play games with driving SO when CSn is high?
 * Which would be a royal pain in the ass.
 *
 *
 * H/W reconfiguration:  (supports both single and dual chip implementations)
 *
 * 1) RESETN, VREG, CSN, SO, SI, and SCLK on individual pins.
 * 2) gp0 -> SFD.  It must be on a capture capable pin
 * 3) gp1 -> tx_active for SFD capture
 * 4) gp2 -> EXCEP_A (completions and errors)
 * 5) gp3 -> not used.   reserved for HGM
 * 6) gp4 -> not used.   reserved for EN
 * 7) gp5 -> not used.   reserved for PA_EN
 * 7) FIFO, FIFOP, SFD, and CCA, are available in FSMSTAT1.
 * 8) Current size of the rxfifo is determined from RXFIFOCNT.
 *
 *
 * Basic Packet operations:
 *
 * The radio chip can actively be doing only one thing at a time, either
 * transmitting or receiving.  It is not Hear-Self.
 *
 * TX:
 *
 * 1) Transmit.   Single packet transmit only.  No pipeline support
 *    (another packet is not sent until the first has been signalled
 *    complete).   Only one packet may be in the TxFifo at a time
 *    (pg 67, CC2520 data sheet).  If another TX attempt is made while
 *    a transmit is still active, it is rejected with EBUSY.
 *
 * 2) Typically, tx packets are ack'd and reception of the ack (rx cycle)
 *    must complete before the next packet gets transmitted.  This is
 *    because the ACK is part of the Channel assignment.   ACK's don't
 *    do CCA but assume the channel is available.  The timing budget for
 *    the transmitted packet is supposed to include the time it takes for
 *    the ACK as well.  This sequencing is handled by the upper layers (not
 *    the driver).
 *
 * 3) Transmission begins by copying the MAC header down to the FIFO.
 *
 * 4) A STXON or STXONCCA is done depending on packet settings.
 *
 * 5) It is possible that the transmission is deferred because the channel
 *    is busy.   This is detected by checking what state the chip is in via
 *    the Status byte or the TX_A signal.
 *
 * 6) Deferred TX packets may be tried again by the upper layer.  A deferred
 *    packet is indicated by an EBUSY return.
 *
 * 7) Timestamping.  If the transmission has started, the rising edge of SFD
 *    will indicate the start of the TX packet, TX status indicates that the
 *    timestamp corresponds to the TX packet.
 *
 *
 * RX:
 *
 * 1) Normal chip state when on is RX_ON and the chipset is waiting for an
 *    incoming frame.
 *
 * 2) The first indication that a receive is happening is a rising edge on
 *    SFD which indicates completion of SFD and start of FrameLength.  CCA
 *    will go low when the Preamble has started to be transmitted.  A
 *    timestamp is taken and RX status indicates the receive.
 *
 * 3) The rising RX_sfd transitions the state machine into RX_ACTIVE state.
 *
 * 4) The falling edge of SFD transitions to RX_ON.
 
 * 5) completion of the packet is indicated by a RX_FRM_DONE exception.  This
 *    causes the packet to be copied out of the RXFIFO and when complete a
 *    RadioReceive.receive signal is generated.
 *
 * Note: There can be multiple RX packets in the fifo and the RX_FRM_DONE
 * exception is a single indicator.  If it is cleared, it won't be asserted
 * again until a new frame is received.
 *
 * Define CC2520_2591 if using 2591 h/w.

  /*----------------- IRQs -----------------*/

  /*
   * We use SFD capture interrupts to denote packet edges and to sequence the
   * state machine as packets are transmitted and received.
   *
   * SFD timing values are stored in the SFDQueue along with what radio state
   * we are in (tx or rx).  The SFDQueue is a strict FIFO queue.
   *
   * The SFD capture interrupt should be a higher priority than the exception
   * interrupt.  While on the exception interrupt, interrupts should be
   * reenabled to allow the SFDCapture interrupt to come in if we are being
   * slammed with incoming RX packets.
   *
   * RX sequencing:
   *
   * When the chip is put into RX_ON, RX calibration occurs and the chip is
   * ready to accept packets.  The following is what happens:
   *
   *     SFD rises, SFD capture, SFD interrupt
   *         SFD up, RX mode, insert into SFD queue
   *         -> STATE_RX_ACTIVE
   *
   *     packet completes
   *
   *     SFD falls, SFD capture, SFD interrupt, EXCA (RX_FRM_DONE) interrupt
   *         SFD down, RX mode, complete SFD queue entry.
   *         -> STATE_RX_ON
   *
   * how to handle multiple packets in the rxfifo.
   *
   * Timing:
   *
   * Preamble(4), SFD(1), len(1) -> (6).
   * MPDU(len).  Minimum is FC(2) DSN(1) FCS(2) -> (5).
   *     addressing adds (4)
   *
   * no addressing:
   *   <sfd up> len(1) MPDU(5) <sfd down> preamble(4) sfd(1) <sfd up>
   *     min time: sfd_up to sfd_down: 192us
   *     min time: sfd_down to sfd_up: 160us   (b2b happens?)
   *     min time: sfd_up to sfd_up:   352us
   *
   * short addressing:
   *   <sfd up> len(1) MPDU(9) <sfd down> preamble(4) sfd(1) <sfd up>
   *     min time: sfd_up to sfd_down: 320us
   *     min time: sfd_down to sfd_up: 160us
   *     min time: sfd_up to sfd_up:   480us
   *
   * Performance issues:
   *
   * 1) TX doesn't have an issue (but it can effect RX timing).   TXfifo can
   *    only have one packet so isn't a gating issue.
   *
   * 2) RX packets don't get copied out until RX_FRM_DONE.   This is to
   *    minimize complexity.  However with back to back packets we only
   *    have 160us to handle the sfd_down and RX_FRM_DONE which includes
   *    coping the packet out.
   *
   *    ==> need the SFD interrupt to preempt any frame processing being
   *    done at a lower level.
   *
   *    ==> under load this means multiple packets in the rxfifo.
   *
   * TimeSync messages:
   *   TimeSync messages require that an absolute time that is embedded
   *   in the TX packet be modified to a time relative to the start of
   *   the packet's SFD.  We want this to be as accurate as possible which
   *   requires a good SFD timing value for the TX packet on the way out.
   *   This is done if the TX took.
   *
   *   A timesync message is defined to have the last 4 bytes of its
   *   data as the absolute time value (32 bits) of some event that
   *   occurred.   When transmitted it is converted to a time relative
   *   to the SFD rising edge of timesync packet.   Time of the event
   *   at the receiving end is then T_sfd + T_rel + T_transit.
   *
   *   When a timesync message is being sent, the full message minus the
   *   last 4 bytes is written to txfifo.  The original absolute time
   *   is stored in m_timesync_absolute, which if set to non-zero
   *   indicates to SFDCapture that a timesync is being done.   This
   *   value is initilized by RadioSend.send.   This keeps the overhead
   *   down to a minimum in the capture interrupt code.
   *
   *   If for some reason we have taken too long to get to actually
   *   processing the SfdCapture interrupt it is possible for the
   *   timesync transmit to generate a TX_UNDERFLOW/Exception.  Note,
   *   The SFD_up will occur first because it is a higher priority than
   *   the exception interrupt.   SFD processing is run to completion.
   *
   *   TX_UNDERFLOW gets caught in exception interrupt processing and
   *   generates a Panic which then resets the radio h/w back to RX_ON.
   *   This will also reset the SfdQueue.
   *
   * Edge Lossage:
   *
   * It is possible to lose an SFD edge.  The code is explicitly written
   * to recover from this situation.  The state machine always returns
   * to RX_ON (it may take another SFD edge, which is guaranteed to happen
   * if we either transmit or if a RX starts to occur).
   *
   * When in an Overwritten state, time stamps are crap until resync'd.
   * This happens after the rxfifo has been drained.   Either flushed or
   * packet processing.
   *
   * We don't try to keep any sequencing after the SfdQueue becomes crap.
   * there really isn't any point, since we lost an edge.  We no longer
   * even know where we are.
   *
   * Normal operation:
   *
   * 1) Rising edge of SFD.  Gets new entry at sfd_fill.
   * 2) marked SFD_BUSY | SFD_UP
   * 3) sfd_entries++, one more active entry.
   * 4) state goes to {RX,TX}_ACTIVE.
   *
   * 5) falling edge of SFD.  uses same sfd_fill entry.
   * 6) marked SFD_DOWN
   * 7) sfd_fill gets incremented.
   *
   * 8) {RX,TX}_FD (frame done) exception processes entry from
   *    sfd_drain side of queue.  FIFO.
   * 9) entry marked ~SFD_BUSY.
   * 10) sfd_entries--
   *
   *
   * Overwritten Operation:
   *
   * When in an SFD overwritten state (1 or more SFD edges have been lost), we
   * ignore all timestamps in the queue.  We don't try to figure out which
   * edge (timestamp) got lost.
   *
   * We can resync the SFDQueue, when both TX and RX are quiescent.  This will
   * occur when the RXFIFO has been drained and the number of sfd_entries is 0.
   * When in overwrite status, sfd_entries at most will be 1, when a new RX
   * frame has been seen (SFD rising).
   *
   * While in overwrite, we only care about being in the middle of an RX packet,
   * in which case we have an active SFD entry being worked on.   We don't want
   * to yank that entry out by processing an exception and then trying to
   * resync the SfdQueue.  So we need to keep try of this state.  (this is
   * denoted by sfd_entries being 1).
   *
   * We also don't want to run out of SFDQueue entries if we continue to be
   * hammered.  New entries keep getting assigned, but we haven't been able
   * to resync yet because we have stayed busy.  We just make sure we
   * can use the next entry.  (SFDDown logic takes care of this).
